# 🚀 React Zero to Monster

This repository documents my **first four days of learning React**, focusing on **core fundamentals** and gradually introducing **important modern concepts** through hands-on practice and mini projects.

The goal of this phase was to build a **strong foundation** before moving into advanced React patterns.
