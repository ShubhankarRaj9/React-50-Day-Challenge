# 🚀 React Zero to Monster
This repository documents my **first four days of learning React**, focusing on **core fundamentals** and gradually introducing **important modern concepts** through hands-on practice and mini projects.

The goal of this phase was to build a **strong foundation** before moving into advanced React patterns.

---
## ✅ Phase 1: Foundations (Days 1–4)
### 📌 What I Covered 

### 1️⃣ Project Setup & Basics
- Setting up a React project using modern tooling
- Understanding the project folder structure
- Learning which files are **essential in the initial phase**, such as:
  - `index.html`
  - `main.jsx`
  - `App.jsx`
  - `package.json`
- Understanding how React renders components to the DOM

---

### 2️⃣ Components in React
- Creating and using **functional components**
- Understanding JSX syntax and rules
- Component reusability and composition
- Passing data using **props**
- Basic project structuring for scalability

---

### 3️⃣ State Management & Hooks
- Introduction to **React Hooks**
- Deep dive into:
  - `useState` for state management
  - `useEffect` for handling side effects
- Understanding component lifecycle behavior with hooks
- Exploring additional hooks conceptually for future learning

---

### 4️⃣ Advanced Concepts Introduced
- **Prop Drilling**
  - Understanding the problem
  - Passing data across multiple component levels
- **React Portal**
  - Rendering components outside the root DOM hierarchy
  - Practical use cases such as modals and popups

---

## 🧩 Libraries & Tools Used

### 🎨 Icons
- **react-icons**
- 🔗: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons/io/
  - Used for adding clean, scalable icons
  - Improved UI readability and aesthetics

### 📦 External APIs & JSON Data
- **JSONPlaceholder**
- 🔗: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
  - Used for working with mock JSON data
  - Practiced API-like data handling and rendering
